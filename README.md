First, we had the plan to solve the hospital challenge that was included in the project ideas. After that, we thought a little about what else might make sense. We came up with the idea of the zoo, because there are many hereditary and interfaces. After that we first made the class diagram and determined the usecases. We created the classes and could start implementing them. We realized that it would be smartest to work with packages. We were able to finish the idea with the packages successfully. When we were about halfway with the implementation, we started writing the documentation and revising our class diagram. We were able to follow our plan, which was to write the program first, then continue with the small documentation in between, and finally finish everything and complete the tests.
